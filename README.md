This project renders a 3D book based on data from archive.org. The controls are as follows:

- space: start/stop the book's rotation
- up/down arrow: open/close the book
- left/right arrows: flip the pages

Right now, it only loads a single book (The Wizard of Oz), but the plan is to make it into a general reader for archive.org book content.
